## Clone the Repository

To begin, clone this repository to your local machine using either **Git** or by downloading the ZIP archive.

Using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victor1890/technical-test-cnc.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive by clicking the Code button on the repository page and selecting Download ZIP.

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory using your terminal:

```sh
cd technical-test-cnc
```

Before running the project, you need to install its dependencies. You can do this by running:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

## Set Up Environment Variables

The project might require certain environment variables to be set in order to function correctly. Create a ``.env.local`` file in the root of the project and add the required variables:

```sh
VITE_SERVER_API=https://api.example.com
```

Replace ``https://api.example.com`` with the actual base URL needed for your project.

## Run the Project

Once you have installed the dependencies and set up the environment variables, you can now run the project:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a refresh in the browser.
